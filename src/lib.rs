//! Core abstractions of the Real Time For the Masses (RTFM) framework
//!
//! You can write generic *libraries* by using the `Resource` trait in this
//! crate. If you want to write application code then you'll need an
//! implementation of the RTFM framework for a particular architecture.
//! Currently there are implementations for these two architectures:
//!
//! - [ARM Cortex-M](https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rtfm)
//! - [MSP430](https://crates.io/crates/msp430-rtfm)
